# DevConnector
This is a social network app for developers allowing users to login/register, create a profile containing their education/experience and other info, and create/comment/like/delete posts.
This was a web app project made using the MERN full stack while learning the MERN stack through a Udemy course called MERN Stack: Front to Back by Brad Traversy.

## What I learned
- Using MongoDB using mongoose package from npm

- Communicating with an API (get/post/delete http requests)
- Ability to CRUD what gets sent and received from the database
- Validation and error handling in the back end with .catch after fetching promises
- Using Passport and JWT Token authentication to register users and have them login using a token that expires after a certain time
- Using redux to maintain application level state (actions sent to reducers, updates store)
- Using lifecycle methods such as componentWillReceiveProps which works well with a state manager such as redux
- Using bootstrap to style the components
- Using Heroku to deploy application
